Known issues: 
-Textures alters lighting, makes everything look dimmer
-Textures do not apply to individual objects, cannot be loaded or saved

-Materials cannot be applied to a selected object unless the object was selected by being clicked
-(new objects added to the scene are initially selected, but materials cannot be applied to them, until clicked)

-If multiple objects are added to the scene, hitboxes will be drawn around all of them, but only the last object added to the scene is selected
-Hitboxes do not rotate with the object, and are not scaled properly for larger objects
-Hitboxes have materials applied to them, hard to see in some cases

-Backface culling doesn't work on objects, but it does on the ground plane
